                                   What´s Viking
********************************************************************************

Viking is a frontend to use FreeSWITCH as a VoIP Platform for wholesale aplication
and Calling Card application (Not in git yet). It was developed by one person, so 
if you find something you don't like, work on it and add it to the git :)

It was created using only open source software, like FreeSWITCH (Obvious), MySQL, 
php, lua and perl.

Now, don't go crazy expecting a full-blown GUI, it is not, web development is not
my cup o' tea, as you soon find out ;)


********************************************************************************
                                   Features
********************************************************************************

Features include all the following parameters configurable via web interface:

- Profile creation based on server IP where traffic is received. You can have 
multiple IPs, system will create multiple profiles/diaplans so it can differentiate.
     i.e. offer to the same customer a "gold" routing on IP1 and cheap routing 
     on IP2

- Customer add/modify/delete
   - IP source
   - Rates for client routes based on area code
   - Prepaid or postpaid.
   - When customer balance is 0, no more calls are allowed.
   - limit max channels
   - Media by-pass
      - When by-passed, customer and provider will exchange RTPs directly. Else, 
      server will be in the middle.

- Provider add/modify/delete
   - Costs for provider routes based on area code
   - Limit max channels

- Routing based on areacode, gives greater granularity.
- Routes can be assigned multiple gateways/providers which can in turn be 
distributed based on weight. Includes overflow to next configured GW.
- Basic financial report generation (totals) by customer/provider
- Basic traffic ASR/ACD report (totals) by customer/provider
- Basic user administration. (No access level, only total access)
- CDR export to csv file.
- A lot more, just take a look at the GUI :)

                              Prerequisites
********************************************************************************

In order to run Viking, you need the following configured and working:

- FreeSWITCH
- MySQL
- lua and luaSQL
- Apache2
- PHP
- Perl with DBI

Viking was designed to work on TWO (2) servers behina a third one acting as a 
firewall, I personally use pfsense but you can use whichever you fancy. And to 
communicate with each other via an private network.


  
                       INTERNET                    
  
                           |
                           |
                   pfsense/ARPProxy
                           |
                           |
       ___________________/ \__________                                            
      /                                \
 ____/______                    ________\__________
/     FS    \____Private IPs___/    MySQL/Apache2  \
\___________/                  \___________________/


Make SURE to check "modules.conf.xml" for the modules you need with FreeSWITCH

********************************************************************************

The git structure is pretty straight-forward.



FreeSWITCH-Billing
 |
 |---> gateway (FreeSWITCH)
 |        |
 |        |---> conf
 |        |      |
 |        |      |---> autoload_configs
 |        |      |
 |        |      |---> dialplan
 |        |
 |        |---> scripts
 |
 |---> gateway-scripts
 |
 |---> web_sql
         |
         |---> web (Apache's www dir)
         |      |
         |      |---> fsxml
         |      |
         |      |---> webint
         |
         |---> sql



gateway:

Contains all configuration files needed to run Viking. You should copy those files
to freeswitch's /usr/local/freeswitch directory. The structure is the same. 

     gateway/conf/vars.xml - This is the usual freeswitch config file, plus a few
                             variables used when starting up viking/freeswitch.
                             You need to set those variables, the crucial is
                             viking_xml_gateway. This variable points to the 
                             private IP address of the Apache2/MySQL installation.
                             FreeSWITCH will get gateways.php file from the fsxml 
                             folder. i.e. http://1.2.3.4/fsxml/gateways.php
                             
     gateway/conf/*         FreeSWITCH config files NOT default, you should make 
                             sure it will work on your setup.

     dialplan/public.xml -   I don't think I use that anymore, but it's still there,
                             copy it anyway.
                             
     gateway/scripts/*       This dir contains the lus scripts which do the actual
                             routing.
     
gateway-scripts:

Contains watchdog and other scripts needed to do tracing (low level), FS config 
reload when the database changes, etc. (I've found the hard way that you can't just
kill and reload gateways)

You need to create a cron job like the following:

# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * *       /home/david/watchdog_viking_reload.sh
* * * * *       /home/david/watchdog_viking_trace.sh
* * * * *       /home/david/watchdog_viking_get_calls.sh


web_sql:

     web_sql/web/* -          Contains the GUI frontend, copy those into the 
                               /var/www (debian/ubuntu) directory, including 
                               subfolders, etc.
                               
     web_sql/sql/             Contains a mysqldump for the complete database used
                              by viking.

********************************************************************************

- Bugs: MANY!
- Fixes: Non, just yet :( need time (and money, hehe)

Seriously now, I will be creating a bug-tracker somewhere. If anyone wants to help,
you're welcome!

Also, for now it is all in spanish, as I did this in the beginning for a customer,
I need to start translating it :( NOT looking forward to that!
